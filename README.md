Handwriting in Android

How to handwriting in Android, with two parts in one application:

1/Drawing board
- which is the first screen where you can draw gesture and check if your drawing matches with one of the gesture save in your personal list
- At your first use you have to create at least one gesture.
- open the gesture builder to add new gesture.

2/Gestures builder (I used the gesture builder sample of android-2.1 with some modifications)
- you have a list of gestures, you can press an item to rename or delete
- you can add a new gesture
- save a new file of your list of gestures at the root of your phone device


-> Use case:

1/ First use, create your list of gestures: a file with your list of gestures will be saved in the root of your phone
2/ Then go back on the drawing board to draw a gesture (digit or letter)
3/ Check by toast message if your draw matches to one of your gesture saved in your list.
4/ You can add/delete/rename a gesture
