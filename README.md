Handwriting in Android

How to handwriting in Android, with two parts in one application:
*Drawing board*
- which is the first screen where you can draw gesture and check if your drawing matches with one of the gesture save in your personal list
- At your first use you have to create at least one gesture.
- open the gesture builder to add new gesture.

*Gestures builder* (I used the gesture builder sample of android-2.1 with some modifications)
- you have a list of gestures, you can press an item to rename or delete
- you can add a new gesture
- save a new file of your list of gestures at the root of your phone device
